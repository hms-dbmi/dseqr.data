Description: Supporting experiment and annotation data for 'dseqr' and
    'rkal' packages. Experiment data for 'dseqr' includes CMAP02 and L1000 
    perturbation expression profiles and associated perturbation metadata. 
    Annotation data for 'rkal' includes transcript to gene mappings for 
    importing 'kallisto' pseudo quantification results. Pre-built transcript
    to gene mappings are included for human and mouse data and a functional
    interface is provided for generating transcript to gene mappings for other
    species.
